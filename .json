Okay, let's absolutely make sure D3.js (I'm assuming "dz3" was a typo for "D3") is properly integrated and ready to go in your Nullxyz project. "Properly here" means it's installed, correctly imported, and being used in the right way within your modern JavaScript setup.
Based on our recent discussions and the setup we outlined:
1. D3.js Installation (Via npm)
 * Check: Open your package.json file in the root of your Nullxyz directory. You should see d3 listed under dependencies.
   {
  "name": "your-d3-widget",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A reusable D3.js graphing widget.",
  // ... other stuff
  "dependencies": {
    "d3": "^7.8.5", // Or whatever the latest version was when you installed
    "gl-matrix": "^3.4.3",
    "dhtmlx": "^latest-version" // If you installed dhtmlx
  },
  // ... other stuff
}

 * Confirmation: If d3 is there, and you've run npm install, then D3.js's files are correctly downloaded into your node_modules folder, making it available to your project.
2. D3.js Import in JavaScript
 * Check: Open your main JavaScript file, js/main.js (or js/cube.js if you named it that). At the very top, you should have the correct ES module import statement:
   import * as d3 from 'd3';
// ... rest of your code

 * Confirmation: This line correctly tells your bundler (Vite) to include D3.js in your final bundled output and makes all D3.js functions available under the d3 namespace within that file.
3. D3.js Usage in Code
 * Check: Your js/main.js code should then be using d3 methods like:
   * d3.select("#tesseract-svg") or d3.select(this)
   * .attr(), .style()
   * .selectAll().data().join() for efficient element management
   * .append(), .remove()
   * .on() for event handling
 * Confirmation: The example cube widget code provided previously uses these methods extensively, confirming D3.js is being utilized as intended for DOM manipulation and data binding.
4. D3.js Loading in index.html (Crucial for Bundled Setup)
 * Check: Your index.html should not have a separate <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script> line if you are bundling D3.js with Vite. Instead, it should load your bundled output file.
   <body>
    <script type="module" src="./dist/my-d3-widget.es.js"></script>
    </body>

 * Confirmation: When you run npm run dev, Vite transparently handles the bundling, and the type="module" script tag correctly loads your application's entry point, which imports and uses D3.js. When you run npm run build, it creates the dist folder with the final optimized bundle, which index.html then loads.
In summary: Yes, based on the setup we've gone through, D3.js is properly implemented and integrated into your Nullxyz project for modern web development using npm and Vite.
You've got the correct npm installation, ES module imports, and D3.js methods in your code. The vite build process ensures it all comes together efficiently.
A Quick Note on DHTMLX:
Just as a reminder, while DHTMLX is installed, its active integration into the visual layout (e.g., creating DHTMLX grids, layouts, or forms) is a separate step that you'd implement by importing its components (import { Layout, Grid } from 'dhtmlx';) and using their APIs in your JavaScript. The README.md clearly states this as a future consideration.
Are you ready to move on to the actual implementation of the game theory graph?
